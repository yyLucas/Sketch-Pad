1. I have implemented the Save function, which is the save() method in DrawView class.

2. The email function, which is the email() method in DrawView class.

3. "Drag and draw" function which allows using drag to customize the size of the shape.

4. A line shape which allows user to draw a line.

5. Selection <xml> for different state of the buttons, 
it helps user to identify which color or shape is selected.

All the functions have been tested on both my private laptop and lab machine using the required emulator,
and I have gave clear comments about methods and classes I made. If you have any other questions, please feel
